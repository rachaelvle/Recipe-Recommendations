Stir to coat with oil, then spread out in pan and let sit; you want it cook a bit and to caramelize (get a bit brown), which will bring out the sweetness. After a couple of minutes, stir and spread out again.</li><li>Add cold rice (it separates easily, so it won't clump up during cooking), plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and, again, spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom. Let it sit for about two minutes—so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy. Add the peas and broccoli and stir again. Drizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.</li><li>Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat. Add chopped scallion tops and toss.</li><li>I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw, chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.</li><li>Season to taste with salt and, if you'd like, more soy sauce.

Add 1/4 of an avocado sliced, top with chopped fresh cilantro.</li><li>NOTES:</li><li>*1 The beans do not need to be soaked before adding to the slow cooker. They will be perfectly soft and creamy without pre-soaking.</li><li>*2 Substitute the water for: 2 cups water and 1 bottle of good quality dark beer like Negra Modelo. You can also substitute the water for chicken stock or pork stock. Each of these substitutions will add an extra dimension of flavor.</li><li>*3 If you want to shred the pork, it is easiest to do when the pork is hot. Use two forks to pull the pork apart and shred. If you want to slice the pork (like for sandwiches) it is best to do when the pork is cold. Let the pork rest in the refrigerator for several hours or over night. Slice with a serrated knife or a very sharp chef knife.</li></ol>",

The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat. Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.</li><li>The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!</li></ol>",

I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.\nChop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.\nPlace the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.\nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.\nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.\nEnjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.\nThese wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.",
